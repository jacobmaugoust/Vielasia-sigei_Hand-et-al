## Supplementary analytical data for the article entitled "A 50-million-year-old, three-dimensionally preserved bat skull supports an early origin for modern echolocation" by Suzanne J. Hand, Jacob Maugoust, Robin M.D. Beck, and Maëva J. Orliac

### This repository is divided in two sections.

#### The first one contains data relative to the phylogenetic analysis performed in this study, with:
- a NEXUS matrix with blocks for running the MrBayes analysis, with blocks for running the full and dental only analyses
- a .tre file with the consensus trees
- a .tre file with 1001 post-burnin trees.

#### The Second one contains data relative to the statistical analyses performed in this study, with:
- data used in the R treatment:
  - phylogenetic files, with the 1001 post-burnin trees (file n°1) and the consensus dated trees of Shi & Rabosky 2015 (file n°2), of Amador et al. 2018 (file n°3), and of Alvarez-Carretero et al. 2022 (file n°4)
  - source data corresponding to the supplementary tables S1G (file n°5), S1K (file n°6), S1M (file n°7), S1N (file n°8), S1O (file n°9), and S1P (file n°10)
  - the R script to run the analysis
  - the RData environment after execution of the whole analysis (because some steps are time-consuming).
